# /a - All Commands


### `/acceptgroup`, `/acceptinvite` and `/ag`
This command is an alias for the `/nlag <group>` command, which is used to accept a pending invitation to join a group managed by the NameLayer plugin.

### `/acid`
If your looking at an acid block (usually a reinforced gold, diamond, or netherite block placed as an "acid"), it removes the block above it, assuming it qualifies to be broken by that acid.

###### Acid types and their effects:
|  Material              | Range of Effect                 | Maturation Time |
|:----------------------:|:-------------------------------:|:------:|
|          Gold          |          Nether Brick           |   50   |
|        Diamond         |              Gold               |  300   |
|       Netherite        |        Gilded Blackstone        |  2000  |

`Note:` If the reinforced block above is a higher tier than the acid, it won't break. 

### `/addblacklist`
This command is used to blacklist a player from a specific group, preventing them from ever being invited or added to that group — even if someone with admin privileges tries to.
`/addblacklist <player> <group>`

### `/advfort`
This command activates Advanced Fortification Mode in the Citadel plugin, allowing you to place reinforced blocks for different groups with various reinforcement types (like gold, diamond, or netherite) simultaneously, making large-scale fortifications more efficient and customizable.

###### How to use:
1. Enter Advanced Fortification Mode:
   - Use the command `/advfort` to activate this mode.
2. Place Reinforced Blocks:
   - Once in advanced fortification mode, you'll be able to place reinforced blocks that are associated with multiple groups and reinforcement types at once.
3. Configure Reinforcement Types:
   - You can set up configurations that define which reinforcement types (gold, diamond, netherite) apply to different groups.
   - This helps when you want to differentiate the level of fortifications for specific groups (e.g., stronger fortifications for more trusted groups).

### `/afk`
Toggle's afk status meaning that people know when you are AFK or not.

### `/alerts`
This command is used to toggle the Vulcan's alert messages on and off. Vulcan is a plugin that handles alerts for certain activities on the server, such as block breaking, block placing, or specific player actions.

### `/ally`
This command is part of the Finale plugin, which is currently available only on the PvP server. This command allows you to manage alliances with other players, enhancing cooperative gameplay and combat dynamics.
- `/ally add <player>`: Marks a player as an ally. Allies are indicated with a blue nametag and receive the following benefits:
  - No damage from arrows fired by you.
  - No negative effects from tipped arrows you shoot.​
- `/ally remove <player>`: Unmarks a player as an ally.
- `/ally list`: Displays a list of players you have marked as allies.

### `/autoaccept`
This command is used to toggle the automatic acceptance of group invitations. When enabled, this feature allows you to automatically join groups without manually accepting each invite.
