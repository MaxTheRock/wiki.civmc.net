# Bastion
Below is a list of all Bastion commands:

## `/bastion`
This command is used to manage Bastions, which are special blocks that create protective fields around themselves. These fields prevent certain actions within their range, providing a strategic layer of defense for cities or vaults.​

### Types of Bastions
- **City Bastion**: Typically used to protect large areas due to their low cost and large (100x100) area of effect. They prevent reinforcement and placement of fluids and certain entities such as boats within their range.
- **Vault Bastion**: Inherits all the effects of city bastions but also prevents all other placements. They are typically used in small areas requiring extra protection.

### Using `/bastion` the Command
The `/bastion` command allows you to interact with these protective blocks. While the exact subcommands may vary, common functionalities include:​
- **Placing a Bastion"": Use the command to place a bastion block at your current location.
- **Viewing Bastion Info**: Check the status and properties of nearby bastions.
- **Removing a Bastion**: Destroy a bastion block to deactivate its protective field.

### Important Notes
- **Reinforcement**: Bastions are reinforced blocks, and their effectiveness depends on the reinforcement material used.​
- **Protection Scope**: The protective field of a bastion is limited to its area of effect. Actions outside this range are not protected.​
- **Group Ownership**: Only members of the group that reinforced the bastion can interact with it.​

## `/bsb`
This command is used to toggle BASTION mode, likely related to the Citadel plugin for fortifications.

## `/bsd`
This command is used to remove a Bastion block when clicked. Bastion blocks are used to create protective fields around structures, but sometimes, you may want to remove a Bastion block to deactivate its protection or change its location.

## `/bsf`
This command in CivMC is used to toggle off Bastion Mode, where reinforcing the target block does not create a Bastion.

## `/bsi`
This command in CivMC is used to enter Bastion Info Mode. In this mode, when you click on a block within a Bastion field, it provides information about whether you have access to that Bastion and details about the Bastion block itself.

## `/bso`
This command is used to toggle Bastion Off mode. When activated, this mode disables the creation of Bastions upon reinforcing blocks.
